To upload the page to Github, you will need to open a terminal and run the following commands:

1) Log in as emcsquirrled
2) cd emcsquirrled.github.com
3) git status

Confirm that you are on the 'master' branch, and that there is nothing to commit.
If you are not on branch 'master':

3.2) git checkout master

If there is something to commit:

3.3) git add *
3.4) git commit -m 'updated lasertag page'

Regardless of the optional steps, continue with the upload:

4) git pull origin master

The passkey is the same thing as the login password.

If there are any merge conflicts, contact Mason Fabel (mason.fabel@earthlink.net) for more specific help BEFORE continuing. Otherwise,

5) git push origin master

And it is live! Check http://emcsquirreled.github.com to confirm that the changes were successful.
